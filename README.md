We created a CLI written in Ruby using an API for Factual, a restaurant-finder. 
Once you clone a copy from github, open it in your terminal using the command
                    ruby food_finder.rb
then follow the prompts. It will ask you for your city, state, and the cuisine you are looking for. Once you've submitted
the appropriate information, a list of the 10 top-ranking restaurants for that location and cuisine type will display numerically, along with their addresses.
